                <b>Telepathy:</b> Anya is capable of reading the minds of other people and animals, her ability depicted as small sparks around her head. However, she is sensitive to being in large crowds as she becomes overwhelmed and dizzy by too many thoughts, to the point of getting a nosebleed. Anya finds it difficult to understand complicated minds, such as Loid's. She must also be within a certain distance of her target to read minds.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Classical Language:</b> Anya is mysteriously knowledgeable of classical language, despite having barely learned the subject at school, as Loid notices she could have scored well on her test if she did not have so many spelling mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Resourcefulness:</b> She is shown on numerous occasions to have a decent level of street smarts, saving Loid from potential death using her resourcefulness and quick thinking skills. She is also capable enough to make a makeshift bomb albeit with the knowledge of an aspiring assassin managed to make a peanut bomb.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Basic Self-Defense:</b> Anya has been taught by Yor some early basic self-defense. She is strong enough to send Damian flying several feet with a punch to the face.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Above Average Strength:</b> Anya is capable of sending people flying with a punch, if angered.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Above Average Intelligence:</b> Though it may not seem like it at first, you have to remember that, as a four year old, managed to pass a lot of her Eden tests. Also, classical language is considered advanced in today's society, and she is very good at it (ignore her spelling).
