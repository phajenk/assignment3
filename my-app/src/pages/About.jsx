            <h2><span>Personality</span></h2>
            <p>Anya Forger is the deuteragonist in the Japanese anime and manga series Spy X Family. 
              She is the adoptive daughter of Loid Forger and Yor Forger, having been taking under Loid's care as part of his current mission. 
              In her past life, she is an orphan known as Test Subject 007, where an accidental creation gave her telepathic abilities.
              Anya is a bubbly and cheerful young girl. She appears to be much smarter than she actually is, and while this is probably true to an extent, this is likely artificially inflated because she can read other people's minds, a fact that nobody aside from her is aware of.
              Being an orphan who's hopped between several families before becoming a Forger, she became quickly attached to Loid and Yor as her father and mother respectively. She's also eager to make friends in general, seeing as she had none while at the orphanage. However, despite her apparent maturity, there are aspects of her that reminds you of her age, 
              such as how quickly she became violent towards Damian Desmond, who was teasing her, likely remembering that her father did the same thing to the guy during her school interview for making her cry.
              However, she respects the desires of her parents a lot, and when her mother asked her not to punch people who displease her, 
              and instead smile at them, she did as she was told, although with visible discomfort, 
              noting that she feels her mother lied when she told her that it would make her feel better and defuse the situation.

              Unlike most children, who likely would have been scared of Yor's and Loid's occupations, (assassin and spy respectively), 
              when Anya found out about these facts by reading their minds, (they're still unaware that she knows), 
              she thought they were the coolest thing ever and desperately wanted to be their daughter. 
              In fact, she's responsible for Yor becoming her mother, by pretending to be sad and lonely that she didn't have a mother, 
              which caught Yor's eye, and also caused Loid to pursue Yor more directly.
